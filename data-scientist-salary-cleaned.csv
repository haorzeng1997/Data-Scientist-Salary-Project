Bioinformatics Research Scientist Chromatin Structure,$129K-$205K (Glassdoor est.),"Make an immediate impact. We offer relocation assistance as well as various opportunities for career growth and development.

The Kriwacki lab seeks to understand how phase separation drives the condensation of biomolecules to create liquid-like bodies that mediate diverse biological processes. Importantly, aberrant biomolecular condensation is associated with several devastating human diseases, including cancer and neurodegeneration. A new initiative in the laboratory addresses the role of aberrant phase separation by fusion oncoproteins as drivers in cancer (e.g., NUP98 fusions in AML & AEL). We use integrative approaches, involving a combination of cell and molecular biology, biophysical, and live and fixed cell imaging techniques, coupled with genomics and computational methods, to determine how phase separation by NUP98 (and other) fusion oncoproteins contributes to the formation of aberrant transcription centers on chromatin that drive aberrant gene expression, transform hematopoietic cells and drive oncogenesis. We seek an analytical and self-motivated researcher to join the team as a Bioinformatics Research Scientist to participate in experiments to probe the influence of fusion oncoproteins on chromatin structure, dynamics and function.
Perform analyses of large genomics dataset that report on fusion oncoprotein binding to chromatin (e.g., ChIP-seq), and their effects on gene expression (e.g., RNA-seq), chromatin accessibility (e.g., ATAC-seq) and chromatin structure (e.g., HiC and Capture-C).
Perform integrative analyses of these large datasets to evaluate correlations between fusion oncoprotein phase separation and chromatin structure (e.g., epigenetic landscape and 3D structure) and function (e.g., gene expression).
Assist others in the laboratory with the design and analysis of large genomics datasets and provide training in these areas.
Perform project management for studies involving multiple large-scale genomics datasets for multiple fusion oncoprotein-related projects.
Participate in the creation and optimization of bioinformatics pipelines used for the analysis of fusion oncoprotein amino acid sequences to identify folded domains and disordered regions, assess phase separation propensity, and identify and characterize low-complexity regions.
Manage databases of fusion oncoprotein DNA and protein sequence, information on associated cancer type and incidence, and information on biological function (e.g., GO terms for the parents of fusion oncoproteins).
Properly conducts specific projects, maintains efficient laboratory operations and may assist in training other laboratory personnel.
Performs other duties as assigned or directed in order to meet the goals and objectives of the department.
Ph.D. in Molecular Biology, Biochemistry, Computer Science, Statistics, Mathematics, Bioinformatics or related field required
Ph.D which must include research related to bioinformatics (such as analysis of sequence data, microarrays, SNPs, image data, proteomics data, or biological pathways; development of algorithms, statistical methods, or scientific software); OR If Ph.D with no bioinformatics research, then two (2) years of pre-or postdoctoral experience in Computational Biology or Bioinformatics research is required.

Analysis: Exceptional problem-solving skills with a good understanding of statistical/social science research methods; 4+ years hands-on experience in an analytics role (e.g., economic consulting)
Working Style: Intellectually curious (keep pulling on threads until finding an answer), enterprising (eager to tackle the unknown and find a way to make things happen), and collaborative (work with others to explore, build, tear down, and build again)
To be considered for this position, applicants must have the ability to work in the U.S. without a need for current or future visa sponsorship.
About the Interview Process: We want both sides to learn what it would be like to work together.

You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.

Our microservices architecture in AWS ingests hundreds of terabytes daily across many geographic regions. Millions of queries a day analyze hundreds of petabytes of data.

At Sumo Logic, we are building a data platform designed to power the analytics and investigations that are common in the Security Operation Centers of large enterprises. It is designed to accept hundreds of billions of events from security-relevant data sources (detection products, network sensors, log shippers, inventory systems) per day.

And, it is security-focused — it is designed to perform the kinds of stateful analyses that security analysts demand.

You know (or want to write software in) Scala.
You love collecting data about your software as much as writing software that collects data. We measure everything. We make data-driven decisions.
You are collaborative. Nothing this hard can be accomplished by working alone. We work as a team.

Why consider OPI, and why do people dig working here?
Variety of consulting; new technologies, projects, and people on a regular basis.
Stability; we’ve been around since 1996 and have a diverse mix of clients and technologies to keep us busy, very busy. And we keep a bench. If you’re not on a project, you’re writing software for our internal business functions or you’re learning new technologies. It’s in our benefit to make our consultants as marketable as possible. That’s good for your career.
No politics or management; we don’t get in the way. Why sit in meetings all day when you can code and be productive?
Awesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new Macbook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.
You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.
Low company overhead. It all means more money back into our consultants pockets (profit sharing) or company trips and events to share in the financial success.

Qualifications

Design and development of streaming data platforms using Kafka Streams, Spark, Flink, Storm, Beam or Cloud Dataflow.

Passion for software development. Someone that loves what they do, that aren’t just in it for a paycheck. Do you have dev projects going on at home at all times?
New projects, new teams, new technologies means having to adjust and learn all the time. You might get thrown on a DevOps project as well, so having the ability to jump in and get your feet wet without hesitation is important. If you don’t want to grow and learn, we’re not a fit.
Positive, can-do attitude. We can teach the technology, but we can’t teach how to approach client challenges with a positive, helpful demeanor. The best consultants aren’t the most technical (although that sure helps), it’s the consultant that will do whatever it takes to see a client be successful, no matter what they throw at you.",4.8,"Object Partners

Based on years of cutting-edge research at Stanford, Sisu enables users to quickly and comprehensively understand what’s driving their key metrics, so they never miss a window of opportunity to act.

Sisu leverages the massive amounts of data available within private, first-party data warehouses, which capture a real-time, structured view of organizational behavior. By monitoring the performance of key metrics like revenue, retention, and churn, and their relationships to interactions between key factors like user demographics, campaigns, and acquisition channels, we can help users make better decisions. The key problem Sisu solves is to help identify what’s driving change among this enormous feature and hypothesis space. To do so, we combine statistical analysis and machine learning at scale to provide users personalized, real-time diagnoses of changes in their metrics via an explainable, interpretable user interface.

Our mission is to transform insurance for small businesses by combining world-class technology and phenomenal customer service to offer better insurance at a lower price. Next has raised over $380 million from top tier investors and is the valley’s latest unicorn, valued at over $1 billion.

Next is well-positioned to become the leader in the $140 billion small business insurance market because we offer a 100% online experience that is tailored to unique business needs and we get customers insured in minutes – something no one else does. Despite the size of the market, the experience of buying small business insurance has not caught up with best practices instituted in other industries like banking, lending, and even personal lines insurance. There is still a lot of paper involved, purchasing a policy can take days or even weeks, and the coverage is so complex that it’s hard for entrepreneurs to understand what they are buying. We’re here to change that. Our goal is to make insurance simple, affordable, and transparent for small businesses so they can stop worrying about insurance and focus on running their businesses.

We are looking for a driven Data Scientist to help us bring machine learning to the insurance industry. As a data scientist at Next Insurance, you will work on a wide range of projects, including building predictive risk models, fine-tuning user experience, and optimizing internal operations.

You’ll also have day-to-day exposure to multiple members of the company leadership team and will be joining a small, nimble team of 5+ scientists, with lots of room for growth and impact.

Responsibilities:


Research and develop predictive models (we typically start with a POC and then work with Product and Engineering counterparts to transition to production)

Iterate and pivot quickly to deliver MVP solutions. Design quick experiments to maximize learning

Understand the data and dig deep to extract actionable insights

Think creatively and outside the box to answer desired experimental questions

Work cross-functionally with engineering, product, marketing, business intelligence, insurance operations, customer support, senior management, and external partners

Desired Skills and Experience:


2-4 years of hands-on experience in data mining, machine learning and/or statistical analysis

BS/MS in Computer Science, Statistics, Applied Math, or related areas

Experience in writing both agile exploratory analyses as well as production-level code in a fast-paced environment

Ability to communicate the results of analyses clearly and effectively

Fluency with an analytical programming language (APL) (preferably Python) and the standard numerical packages

Fluency with data extraction/manipulation tools (preferably SQL & Pandas)

One of our core values is ‘Play as a Team’; this means making sure everyone has an equal chance to participate and make a difference. We win by playing together. Next Insurance is an equal opportunity employer and prioritizes building a diverse and inclusive workplace. We provide equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants of any type and do not discriminate based on race, color, religion, national origin, gender, age, sexual orientation, physical or mental disability, genetic information or characteristic, gender identity and expression, veteran status, or other non-job-related characteristics or other prohibited grounds specified in applicable federal, state, and local laws.

Next is well-positioned to become the leader in the $140 billion small business insurance market because we offer a 100% online experience that is tailored to unique business needs and we get customers insured in minutes – something no one else does. Despite the size of the market, the experience of buying small business insurance has not caught up with best practices instituted in other industries like banking, lending, and even personal lines insurance. There is still a lot of paper involved, purchasing a policy can take days or even weeks, and the coverage is so complex that it’s hard for entrepreneurs to understand what they are buying. We’re here to change that. Our goal is to make insurance simple, affordable, and transparent for small businesses so they can stop worrying about insurance and focus on running their businesses.

We are looking for a driven Data Scientist to help us bring machine learning to the insurance industry. As a data scientist at Next Insurance, you will work on a wide range of projects, including building predictive risk models, fine-tuning user experience, and optimizing internal operations. You will enable us to make the best use of our proprietary data, supplemented with novel data sources which you get to assemble creatively.

You’ll also have day-to-day exposure to multiple members of the company leadership team and will be joining a small, nimble team of 5+ scientists, with lots of room for growth and impact.

Responsibilities:


Research and develop predictive models (we typically start with a POC and then work with Product and Engineering counterparts to transition to production)

Iterate and pivot quickly to deliver MVP solutions. Design quick experiments to maximize learning

Understand the data and dig deep to extract actionable insights

Think creatively and outside the box to answer desired experimental questions

Work cross-functionally with engineering, product, marketing, business intelligence, insurance operations, customer support, senior management, and external partners

Desired Skills and Experience:


2-4 years of hands-on experience in data mining, machine learning and/or statistical analysis

BS/MS in Computer Science, Statistics, Applied Math, or related areas

Experience in writing both agile exploratory analyses as well as production-level code in a fast-paced environment

Ability to communicate the results of analyses clearly and effectively

Fluency with an analytical programming language (APL) (preferably Python) and the standard numerical packages

Fluency with data extraction/manipulation tools (preferably SQL & Pandas)

An SEI Consultant is a master communicator and active listener who understands how to navigate an audience. Self-aware, almost to a fault, SEI consultants keenly understand how to adjust their approach based on the situation. Following a logical, fact-based approach, our consultants possess the superior ability to see correlations others may not, ask the right questions and drive solutions.

As super-connectors, our consultants connect not only people, but data, trends and experiences.

As every project is different, an SEI Consultant must be adaptable and comfortable with unexpected situations. An SEI Consultant must be at ease with ambiguity because although a client knows that a problem exists – they need SEI to figure it out and drive a solution. SEI Consultants define ambition differently. SEI Consultants are authentic, low-maintenance individuals who like to hang out with colleagues outside of work. Whether it be cooking, traveling, hiking, or volunteering, SEI Consultants enjoy working with genuine, thoughtful folks who want to steer clear of the traditional grind and share the joy of day-to-day life and activities with colleagues, friends and family.

Our unique processes result in authoritative, data-driven analyses that assist enterprise managers in making complicated decisions. We offer our customers proven expertise in descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics; advanced mathematics and computational techniques (a.k.a. data science); and software engineering. Our mission is to help enterprise leaders make complex, fully informed decisions and save money in the process. #CJ

Everybody’s view of data science is a little different, and we are no exception. At Veracity, we view data science as a way of understanding “how the world works.” We make assumptions and models then use data of all sorts to validate or disprove them. Our customers ask tough questions about managing their multifaceted enterprises; we build and operate complex models and simulations to provide the answers that best address the decisions they face.
We don’t expect you to come in with all of the subject matter expertise needed to completely understand the data analysis or to create models with the fidelity we require. We do expect you to get there quickly, though. We look for traits such as how you solve problems when you’re stuck. Do you look for creative ways to apply different techniques from tangential disciplines? Do you crack open a book and teach yourself how to do something new? Do you collaborate with your colleagues? If you take initiatives like these, you would fit in well with our team of analysts.
We would love to tell you that we spend all our time developing elaborate algorithms for regression, survival, kernel weighting, etc., but honestly, we spend a lot of time wrangling data.

Evergreen-Data Scientist,$107K-$173K (Glassdoor est.),"Veracity Forecasting and Analysis, an SPA Company, is part of the Joint, Land, Air, and Space Division within SPA. Our unique processes result in authoritative, data-driven analyses that assist enterprise managers in making complicated decisions. We offer our customers proven expertise in descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics; advanced mathematics and computational techniques (a.k.a. data science); and software engineering. Our mission is to help enterprise leaders make complex, fully informed decisions and save money in the process. #CJ

Everybody’s view of data science is a little different, and we are no exception. At Veracity, we view data science as a way of understanding “how the world works.” We make assumptions and models then use data of all sorts to validate or disprove them. Our customers ask tough questions about managing their multifaceted enterprises; we build and operate complex models and simulations to provide the answers that best address the decisions they face.
We don’t expect you to come in with all of the subject matter expertise needed to completely understand the data analysis or to create models with the fidelity we require. We do expect you to get there quickly, though. We look for traits such as how you solve problems when you’re stuck. Do you look for creative ways to apply different techniques from tangential disciplines? Do you crack open a book and teach yourself how to do something new? Do you collaborate with your colleagues? If you take initiatives like these, you would fit in well with our team of analysts.
We would love to tell you that we spend all our time developing elaborate algorithms for regression, survival, kernel weighting, etc., but honestly, we spend a lot of time wrangling data. This includes combing data from disparate data systems, manipulating formats, and cleaning—all of which are required to make the modeling happen. For this critical work we need someone who is precise, efficient, and tenacious.

Evergreen-Data Scientist,$107K-$173K (Glassdoor est.),"Veracity Forecasting and Analysis, an SPA Company, is part of the Joint, Land, Air, and Space Division within SPA. Our unique processes result in authoritative, data-driven analyses that assist enterprise managers in making complicated decisions. We offer our customers proven expertise in descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics; advanced mathematics and computational techniques (a.k.a. data science); and software engineering. Our mission is to help enterprise leaders make complex, fully informed decisions and save money in the process. #CJ

Everybody’s view of data science is a little different, and we are no exception. At Veracity, we view data science as a way of understanding “how the world works.” We make assumptions and models then use data of all sorts to validate or disprove them. Our customers ask tough questions about managing their multifaceted enterprises; we build and operate complex models and simulations to provide the answers that best address the decisions they face.
We don’t expect you to come in with all of the subject matter expertise needed to completely understand the data analysis or to create models with the fidelity we require. We do expect you to get there quickly, though. We look for traits such as how you solve problems when you’re stuck. Do you look for creative ways to apply different techniques from tangential disciplines? Do you crack open a book and teach yourself how to do something new? Do you collaborate with your colleagues? If you take initiatives like these, you would fit in well with our team of analysts.
We would love to tell you that we spend all our time developing elaborate algorithms for regression, survival, kernel weighting, etc., but honestly, we spend a lot of time wrangling data. This includes combing data from disparate data systems, manipulating formats, and cleaning—all of which are required to make the modeling happen. For this critical work we need someone who is precise, efficient, and tenacious.

Evergreen-Data Scientist,$107K-$173K (Glassdoor est.),"Veracity Forecasting and Analysis, an SPA Company, is part of the Joint, Land, Air, and Space Division within SPA. Our unique processes result in authoritative, data-driven analyses that assist enterprise managers in making complicated decisions. We offer our customers proven expertise in descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics; advanced mathematics and computational techniques (a.k.a. data science); and software engineering. Our mission is to help enterprise leaders make complex, fully informed decisions and save money in the process. #CJ

Everybody’s view of data science is a little different, and we are no exception. At Veracity, we view data science as a way of understanding “how the world works.” We make assumptions and models then use data of all sorts to validate or disprove them. Our customers ask tough questions about managing their multifaceted enterprises; we build and operate complex models and simulations to provide the answers that best address the decisions they face.
We don’t expect you to come in with all of the subject matter expertise needed to completely understand the data analysis or to create models with the fidelity we require. We do expect you to get there quickly, though. We look for traits such as how you solve problems when you’re stuck. Do you look for creative ways to apply different techniques from tangential disciplines? Do you crack open a book and teach yourself how to do something new? Do you collaborate with your colleagues? If you take initiatives like these, you would fit in well with our team of analysts.
We would love to tell you that we spend all our time developing elaborate algorithms for regression, survival, kernel weighting, etc., but honestly, we spend a lot of time wrangling data. This includes combing data from disparate data systems, manipulating formats, and cleaning—all of which are required to make the modeling happen. For this critical work we need someone who is precise, efficient, and tenacious.

Evergreen-Data Scientist,$107K-$173K (Glassdoor est.),"Veracity Forecasting and Analysis, an SPA Company, is part of the Joint, Land, Air, and Space Division within SPA. Our unique processes result in authoritative, data-driven analyses that assist enterprise managers in making complicated decisions. We offer our customers proven expertise in descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics; advanced mathematics and computational techniques (a.k.a. data science); and software engineering. Our mission is to help enterprise leaders make complex, fully informed decisions and save money in the process. #CJ

Everybody’s view of data science is a little different, and we are no exception. At Veracity, we view data science as a way of understanding “how the world works.” We make assumptions and models then use data of all sorts to validate or disprove them. Our customers ask tough questions about managing their multifaceted enterprises; we build and operate complex models and simulations to provide the answers that best address the decisions they face.
We don’t expect you to come in with all of the subject matter expertise needed to completely understand the data analysis or to create models with the fidelity we require. We do expect you to get there quickly, though. We look for traits such as how you solve problems when you’re stuck. Do you look for creative ways to apply different techniques from tangential disciplines? Do you crack open a book and teach yourself how to do something new? Do you collaborate with your colleagues? If you take initiatives like these, you would fit in well with our team of analysts.
We would love to tell you that we spend all our time developing elaborate algorithms for regression, survival, kernel weighting, etc., but honestly, we spend a lot of time wrangling data. This includes combing data from disparate data systems, manipulating formats, and cleaning—all of which are required to make the modeling happen. For this critical work we need someone who is precise, efficient, and tenacious.
